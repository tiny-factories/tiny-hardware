<h1>join us</h1>

We are a group of people who are on a journey to find our place at the intersection of art, design, technology, and indiepreneurship. But real talk? This sh*t is hard. Come wander with us! We believe it takes a while to become truly apart of a friend and peer group, so we ask that each membership starts at a minimum of 3 months. And whenever you feel like you are starting a new chapter, it is totally welcomed for you to leave this campsite, but do know that this place will always be here for you!

To keep this community thriving and to support each other, we ask each member to contribute $20 every month.

Membership includes:
A Discord campsite of makers from across the globe, from Amsterdam, Taipei, London, New York, Tokyo, and more. Your own individual channel where you share updates, wip, moodboards, and exchange ideas from other makers (we hop between each other’s channels all the time!) Recurring online gathering sessions with makers of product such as TheirTube, interactive drawing tools, MeTime.fm, NocNoc, shADe extension, MakeSpace, Sashiko bag and many more (these projects all developed as members were hanging out at this campsite)! Group access to tools and educational materialsRepository of useful resources for indiepreneurs
