<p>To truly blossom, this collective of emerging creators and indiepreneurs require a larger support network of individuals,  studios, and organizations. </p>

<p>If you’d like to join our budding community of individual partners committed to the advancement of the next generation creators who are shaping the grammer of creative expression: support a fellow</p>

<p>Is there an amount that I should contribute?</p>

<p>While there are no rigid tiers, we’ve created a guide for what different contribution amount can cover:
  <ul>
    <li>$100 - indiepreneur friend - sponsors our communal software</li>
    <li>$500 - indiepreneur advocate - sponsors toolings for a rising creator</li>
    <li>$1,500 - indiepreneur partner - supports a rising creator for a month</li>
    <li>$9,000 - indiepreneur patron - supports a rising creator for a residency</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<h2>Your contribution goes to establishing the success of this collective and the rising indiepreneurs.</h2> 
We are a self-organized group of committed creators shaping and exploring the grammar of creative expressions. Your contribution is vital because it is what gives these efforts life force and momentum.  

<h2>What are other ways I can contribute?</h2>
Our collective is composed of a group of creators working with different media and we could all benefit from having additional guidance and support. While we don’t have a laundry list of ways for you to support us, here’s a small guide of how you might be able to support us: 
<ul>
<li> <b>Mentorship</b> - have dialogues with us and provide us with guidance as we find our footing and voice as creators and indiepreneurs (this can be an one-time or a recurring engagement depending on your availability)</li>
<li> <b>Opportunities</b> - </li>
<li> <b>Resources</b> - As much as this is a journey to finding our footing, it is also a process of exploring and tinkering with ideas and tools. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>What do I get as an individual partner? </h2>

<p>If you are interested in becoming a studio or organizational partner and would like to explore ways in supporting, accessing, and collaborating with rising indiepreneurs, please contact us at partnership@tinyfactories.space For any other questions related to gifting, sponsorship, and parntership, please email: <a>partnership@tinyfactories.space</a>
